"Redesign the entire website to exude a luxurious, robust, and next-level aesthetic. The design should incorporate 4K resolution elements with a focus on high-end, premium visuals and modern UI/UX practices. Leverage Tailwind CSS to its full potential and ensure the following:

Key Design Guidelines:
Resolution & Graphics:

Use 4K resolution images and assets for a crisp, visually stunning experience.
Incorporate high-quality shadows for depth, giving the site a polished, 3D effect.
Add subtle gradients and glassmorphism effects to sections for a futuristic look.
Layout & Structure:

Ensure a grid-based, symmetrical layout with perfect alignment for consistency.
Maximize white space to create a clean, uncluttered interface.
Use large, bold typography with luxury fonts for headings, paired with clean sans-serif fonts for body text.
Animations & Interactivity:

Add smooth animations for page transitions, hover effects, and interactive elements.
Use 3D animations for buttons, icons, and featured elements.
Integrate subtle parallax scrolling effects for depth and engagement.
Dark/Light Theme Switcher:

Include a theme toggle button to allow users to switch between dark mode and light mode seamlessly.
Ensure both themes maintain the same level of elegance and readability.
Dark theme: Use deep blacks, grays, and gold accents.
Light theme: Use white, soft grays, and green/gold highlights.
UI Features:

Dynamic Navigation Bar: Responsive, sticky navigation with hover effects and smooth dropdown menus.
Cards with 3D Effects: Showcase products or content in cards with hover-activated shadows and animations.
Call-to-Action Buttons: High-contrast buttons with glowing borders or animated gradients.
Technical Implementation:
Use Tailwind CSS for styling:

Leverage utilities for responsive grids, spacing, and custom animations.
Use Tailwind's box-shadow and gradient utilities to add depth and vibrancy.
Add Advanced Interactions:

Implement Framer Motion or GSAP for complex animations.
Use Lottie animations for micro-interactions like button clicks and theme toggles.
Optimize for Performance:

Ensure images are optimized with lazy loading and WebP formats.
Use Tailwind's JIT mode to keep the CSS file lightweight.
Cross-Browser & Device Testing:

Ensure the design is responsive and works seamlessly across all browsers and devices.
Final Deliverables:
A luxurious, high-resolution website with a dark/light theme switcher.
Smooth, high-end animations and 3D effects on interactive elements.
Fully responsive design with a modern, symmetrical layout and a premium feel."
