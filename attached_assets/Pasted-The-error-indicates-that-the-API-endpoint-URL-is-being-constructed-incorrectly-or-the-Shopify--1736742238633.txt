The error indicates that the **API endpoint URL** is being constructed incorrectly or the **Shopify Storefront API** configuration is incomplete. Here's how to fix it and ensure you're calling the correct endpoint:

---

### **Correct Shopify Storefront API Endpoint**
The URL for Shopify's Storefront API is constructed as:
```plaintext
https://{your-store-name}.myshopify.com/api/{api-version}/graphql.json
```

### **Steps to Resolve:**

1. **Verify Your Store Name:**
   - Replace `{your-store-name}` with the actual name of your Shopify store.
   - Example:
     If your store URL is `evolvra.myshopify.com`, the endpoint will be:
     ```plaintext
     https://evolvra.myshopify.com/api/2024-01/graphql.json
     ```

2. **Ensure Correct API Version:**
   - Shopify API versions are date-based (e.g., `2024-01` for January 2024).
   - Confirm you're using a valid version supported by your store.

3. **Set the Correct Endpoint in Code:**
   Update the API URL in your code:
   ```javascript
   const API_URL = 'https://evolvra.myshopify.com/api/2024-01/graphql.json';
   ```

4. **Pass the Required Headers:**
   Ensure you include the `Storefront API Access Token` in the headers:
   ```javascript
   const headers = {
     'Content-Type': 'application/json',
     'X-Shopify-Storefront-Access-Token': '<your-access-token>',
   };
   ```

5. **Test the Endpoint:**
   Use a tool like **Postman** or **cURL** to test the endpoint:
   ```bash
   curl -X POST https://evolvra.myshopify.com/api/2024-01/graphql.json \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -H "X-Shopify-Storefront-Access-Token: your-access-token" \
     -d '{"query":"{ products(first: 5) { edges { node { title } } } }"}'
   ```

6. **Verify the API Key:**
   - Make sure the API key used for the `Storefront API Access Token` matches the correct key generated in Shopify under:
     **Apps > Develop Apps > Your App > Storefront API access token.**

### **Troubleshooting Tips**
1. **Double-check the domain name**: Ensure there are no typos in your store's subdomain (e.g., `your-store-name.myshopify.com`).
2. **Ensure the app is installed**: The app generating the API token must be installed in your Shopify store.
3. **Check API permissions**:
   - The token must have the necessary scopes, such as `unauthenticated_read_product_listings`.
4. **Inspect Network Logs**: Use browser DevTools or server logs to confirm the exact URL being hit.
